# ✨ Customer Segmentation using MiniBatch KMeans Clustering ✨

I’m excited to share my latest project where I applied MiniBatch KMeans Clustering on the Customer Segmentation dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to identify different customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, which can help businesses in creating more personalized marketing strategies.

## Summary of the Process:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, scaled features, and prepared the dataset for modeling.
- **Visualization:** Explored the data to uncover key relationships between variables.
- **MiniBatch KMeans:** Implemented the MiniBatch version of KMeans for faster computation on larger datasets.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed the model performance and interpreted the identified customer segments.
- **Business Insights:** Gained insights that can assist businesses in improving customer experience and boosting sales.
